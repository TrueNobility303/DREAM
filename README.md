# DREAMï¼š An Efficient Stochastic Algorithm for Decentralized Nonconvex-Strongly-Concave Minimax Optimization

The code is based on MPI whose installation can be done followed by this guide at https://ireneli.eu/2016/02/15/installation/.

To reproduce the experiments, run

```
mpiexec -n 8 python demo.py
```

The datasets used in our experiments are available at https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/
